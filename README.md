This script I found in Tidal website (listen.tidal.com) -- https://listen.tidal.com/platform.6d198e4e12fa3ed81d4c.js. I used a deobfuscator to make it more or less readable.
I believe this is script is the cause of the fact that "HIFI" option is only available in Chrome. I did not manage to fake user:agent for Konqueror to make this option available. I'm pretty sure that the reason why is hidden inside of this code. I'm trying to read it but I'm not really fluent in JS. If anybody else wants to join me, you are welcome.
